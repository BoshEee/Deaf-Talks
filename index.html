        <h2>Deafs Talks</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to deafs talk! With this app you can talk safly with your deaf
          partner while you are driving!
        </p>
        <h2>How It Works?</h2>
        <p>
          While you are driving you can't use sign language to talk with your
          partner, or look at your partner while they using sign language and
          loose your focus on the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deafs Talks helps you to speak to them by clicking a button and
          recording what you want to say and display it on the screen so your
          partner can read it. Then, your partner can type what they want to say
          and click the Read button and you will hear what they typed without
          loosing your focus.
